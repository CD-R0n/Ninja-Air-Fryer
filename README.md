Ninja Air Fryer
===============

This is an application I am building to help me and my family setup our Ninja AF451 Air Fryer.  

The Ninja AF451 has a lot of options for cooking a meal,  
of course it's possible to just select `AIR FRY` and set a time and temperature, but by utilizing the more specialized settings and temperature probe, you can achieve really amazing results.  

It is my intention to create a database in which we can store our settings per dish, and allow us to note improvements for the next time we will cook the specific dish.  

I hope to someday release a public version and see if other people might also find this useful.
